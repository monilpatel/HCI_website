        <h3 class="phase0_header"><b>System Concept Statement</b></h3>
        <p>Clue 2.0 will be a modern day upgrade to the classic board game of clue, by providing a new immersive experience utilizing current day technologies. The game will include a new way to keep track of the players clues, cards, and pieces in a manner that brings the game to life. Compared to the current form of the game, Clue 2.0 will offer an innovative digital experience while reducing the time and setup required to play the game and remove the need for the small paper notebooks.This upgrade will alleviate all the old aches and pains of losing game pieces, writing down illegible notes, and the classic general mistrust of friends in a game built upon deceit. A focus on immersive design will emphasis the detective quality of the classic board game while offering friends and family between the age of 8 and 30 new and exciting way to play a game that they already love. The introduction of technology into this board game will bring Clue back into popularity with those who have moved on towards more digital forms of entertainment. </p>

        <h3 class="phase0_header"><b>Contextual Inquiry</b></h3>
        <p>Prior to meeting with current users, as a group we familiarized ourselves with how a typical game of clue is played. Due to the simplicity of the work domain, the preparation for contextual inquiry was an easy process.As a group we met and disscussed what people would be able to hold interviews.Through this meeting we saw that some group members had play the game more often and would be able to find more people to interview. We then brainstormed the initial interview questions to use during the session. We interviewed 3 people about their experiences with clue and board games in general. Because the domain of our project isnt very complex, we decided that 3 different interviews would offer enough insight into how people feel about the game. Most of the contacts tried their best to give thorough answers to the questions we asked. We decided to use these interviews as our main source of raw contextual data. Because the domain isn't very complex we decided that there wasn't a specific need to video tape the interactions. In this regard we primarily used the interviews and note taking as our main source of raw contextual data.</p>

        <p><b><u>Interviews</u></b></p>
        
        <h3 class="phase0_header"><b>Logan</b></h3>
        <b>How many times have you played the game clue?</b>
        <p class="indent">Probably about 5 or 6 times</p>

    <b>Who's your favority character to play as</b>
        <p class="indent">Mrs. White</p>

    <b>Is there something special about her?</b>
        <p class="indent">Actually my friends keep telling me that I look like her so I after a while of arguing with them I just decided to go with it. I try to go all out with the roleplaying aspect of the game now.</p>
        
        <b>What aspect of the game do you enjoy the most?</b>
        <p class="indent">I guess it would have to be when all the clues start to come together. I usualy make a wild prediction in the beginning based off of intution and its fun to see if I was remotely right at the end of the game</p>
        
        <b>What parts of the game would be frustrating to you?</b>
        <p class="indent">Finding enough pencils to play can be very annoying, but what is worse is if you have pencils but no erasers. Also dealing with the small paper notepad can be annoing</p>
        
        <b>Has this frustration ever dettered you from playing the game? </b>
        <p class="indent">Not really, we usually end up finding enough but it does take alot longer to stat playing. And sometimes some of us are forced to play with pens which can be a nightmare if you make a mistake</p>
        
        <b>You mentioned that the notepad could be annoying sometimes, could you elaborate? </b>
        <p class="indent">Sure, so the point of the game is to keep track of the clues that you get with each turn, the game comes with these packets of small "detective" notebooks. The words are tiny on this paper so its hard to read. And theres not really any extra space to write my ideas down so its hard to organize my thoughts on it. </p>
        
        <b>Why do you choose to play clue over a video game? </b>
        <p class="indent">I usually play video games alone so if we are in a group its fun to pass the time with a board game. </p>
        
        <b>What aspects of video games did you wish a board game would have? </b>
        <p class="indent">I guess the graphics aspect is probably the biggest difference to me. Video games are super realistic while board games require more imagination</p>
        
        <h3 class="phase0_header"><b>Sarah</b></h3>
        <b>How many times have you played the game clue?</b>
        <p class="indent">I wouldn't be able to begin count how many times I’ ve played it, probably over a million. </p>

    <b>Who's your favority character to play as</b>
        <p class="indent">I would probably say Colonel Mustard, not really sure why but I usually try to get him. </p>
        
        <b>What aspect of the game do you enjoy the most?</b>
        <p class="indent">I think in generally just interacting with my friends, it’s the type of game that it really makes you think so it’s really fun figuring out who did it.  I like the concept of the detective theme having that notebook kinda feels like the detectives we see in the movies and tv shows.</p>
        
        <b>What parts of the game do you find frustrating?</b>
        <p class="indent">Probably having to set up, finding everyone pencils is also very annoying. I also find it extremely tedious to write down all the clues on the tiny sheet of paper that they give. I like the concept but i wish it was easier to keep track of my thoughts. We’ve ran out/ lost those little detective note sheets so we've had to print off copies. It’s also easy to look over at someone’s notepad.
</p>
        
        <b>Has this frustration ever dettered you from playing the game? </b>
        <p class="indent">Actually a couple of times we were at my friends house and we didn't have any sort of pens or pencils so we had to find something else to do. 
</p>
        
        <b>Why do you choose to play clue over a video game? </b>
        <p class="indent">I dont really play video games. But I like playing clue because of the interaction with everyone. I find it more fun then monopoly which can take a very long time and its not as serious type of game. For me its a more relaxed type of game. Its fun trying to piece together everything, kinda like what a detective does. </p>
        
           <h3 class="phase0_header"><b>Matt</b></h3>
        <b>How many times have you played the game clue?</b>
        <p class="indent">Not reallys sure, play it once or twice when I go back home with my family. Usually play it with my parents and little brother. Here I usually play it with my roomates and other kids in the hall</p>
        
        <b>What is a typical setting you play Clue in?</b>
        <p>Usually around a table big enough to fit everyone. Usually we would play after dinner or in the mid-afternoon on weekends.</p>
        
        <b>What aspect of the game do you enjoy the most?</b>
        <p class="indent">How everyone is equally uncertain about who did it in what room with which weapon. It’s actually treated like a mystery where no one has any clue as to who did it.
</p>
        
        <b>What parts of the game would be frustrating to you?</b>
        <p class="indent">Cheating has always been an issue whenever I play. It’s almost too easy. Another issue is always not having enough pens/pencils or losing pieces of the game. They’re kind of a hassle to keep track of.</p>
        
        <b>Has this frustration ever dettered you from playing the game? </b>
        <p class="indent">Not really</p>
        
        <b>Why do you choose to play clue over a video game? </b>
        <p class="indent">I guess its just a fun way to hang out with friends. Alot of things we do these days are through screens and I find it nice to just interact with people through a board game </p>
    
         <h3 class="phase0_header"><b>Contextual Analysis</b></h3>
        <p>
            In order to create the WAAD, we first followed the book in order to create work activity notes. Each group member was assigned an interview to work off of. Then individually we worked on created work activity notes from the raw contextual data. We were careful to follow the guidelines discussed in the UX book. Tagging each work actvitity note with source ID to ensure that we could find the source. Worked to paraphrase each idea into a declarative statements while also trying to remove the fluff and noise from the interview data. After we individually came up with each note we went in a circle and discussed/read outloud each of the notes that we came up with. We then started the construction of the WAAD. We mixed up all of the work activity notes and distributed them amoung each group member. In the beginning each person would read their work activity note and then placed it on the wall. This process continued until we felt comfortable enought to the point where we started placing the note on the wall simultaneously. Throughout this process we started to see cluster forms and started to create topical labels for each one, these temporary labels were written on the whiteboard above the cluster. When groups started to form we then started to rearrange the corresponding notes into a vertical line and assigned it a group label.

        <p><b>Sample Task Data Collected</b></p>
        <p>Jason had to opportunity to observe a group of people play a game of Clue. Through this process he developed raw user work activity data through observations. Below are a few samples of the task data collected: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>One of the players would never look at their cards and mess up the rest of the game</li>
            <li> People waiting for their turn would not pay attention</li>
            <li>Always forgot whose turns it was</li>
            <li>Argument over what space is considered the door and the room</li>
            <li>Rule book as missing</li>
            <li>One player had to use a pen, cause there wasnt enough writing utensils. he struggled to keep track of his thoughts and his sheets was very unorganized </li>
            <li>die kept falling of the table</li>
            <li>a couple pieces was missing</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><b>Models</b></p>
        <p>As a group we decided to utilize two types of models, a flow model and a social model. The flow model was useful in order to gain a better sense of how the current game is played. Because of the simple work domain, we decided to break the work roles down to two nodes. The player whose turn it is and the players that are waiting for their turn. This made sense to be social model due to the fact that this game is played within groups of people and not individually </p>
