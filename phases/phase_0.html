        <h3 class="phase0_header"><b>Research/analysis</b></h3>
        <p><b><u>Process</u>:</b></p>
            <p class="indent">We utilized contextual inquiry in order to learn more about the current process that students face when signing up and managing teams for intramurals. Interviewed a student who has a lot of experience with intramurals, and was able to watch as they walked through the signup process and discussed how they manage the teams. Was also able to get some artifacts from the interview, including sample pictures of the website and team roster that team captains are sent.
        </p>
        <p><b><u>Interview</u></b></p>
        <b>How many intramurals have you been on at your time at Virginia Tech?</b>
        <p class="indent">I’ve been on about four different intramurals.</p>
        
        <b>How many intramurals have you participated on at once?</b>
        <p class="indent">Just one, never been on two at the same time</p>
        
         <b>Do you usually sign up individually or as a group?</b>
        <p class="indent">	Each person signs up to be eligible to play</p>
        
        <b>Where do you go to sign up?</b>
        <p class="indent">	Tech has an intramural website page</p>
        
        <b>Describe the process of signing up for intramurals and joining a team?</b>
        <p class="indent">Each person must sign up individually and pay the 20 dollar fee.</p>
        <p class="indent">Once they pay they can play as many sports as you want for one year. </p>
        <p class="indent">Each person must watch an intramural sports presentation which takes about 30 min. </p>
        <p class="indent">After the presentation you then go and try to find people to make a team, and someone decides to be captain. </p>
<p class="indent">The captain will submit the team name. The captain then watches an additional presentation about the specific sport rules and is tasked with sharing that information with the rest of the team </p>
        
        <b>Does that document include the members?</b>
        <p class="indent">No it just states the name of the team</p>
        
        <b>Could you elaborate on that presentation?</b>
        <p class="indent">It’s a set of slides with a voiceover that tells you the rules of the leagues, its a pretty tedious and boring process. And you have to watch it each time you sign up, so for me it was once every semester.
</p>
        
         <b>Is there a site which can help you find people to make the team?</b>
        <p class="indent">Not that I know of, it is usually through word of mouth, asking friends. I think there is a individual sign up but i have never done it. </p>
        
         <b>Can any number of teams sign up for a sport?</b>
        <p class="indent">No there is a cap on the number of teams for a specific sport. If that sport fills up then your team will be put on a waitlist.</p>
        
         <b>How do you keep track of the members on your team?</b>
        <p class="indent">So after the captain submits the name, all team members need to come to one of the first two games. Whoever is present for either game will be put on the team. A roster is sent to the captain to confirm its accuracy.</p>
        
         <b>How do you keep track of who can attend which day?</b>
        <p class="indent">We usually just have a group chat to see how many people can attend, i think some other teams might use google calender to keep track but we usually just chat each other. We also have to take a conflict survey which has us select what times M-F we are unable to play. 
</p>
        
         <b>Where do you go to see when and where to play?</b>
        <p class="indent">	We are sent a link after registration to see online who we play and when and where</p>
        
        
        <p><b><u>Finding</u>:</b></p>
            <p class="indent">After observing the user interact and speak about his experience with intramurals we can see that there is a significant disconnect between the individual teams and members. A lot of responsibility and information goes through the team captain but not directly accesible to each member. It seems as though students dont really advertise or try to find other students outside of their friends group. Keeping track of who can play and when they play appears to be very loose with no consistent way of seeing everyones schedule easily. The process also appears to be repetitive, especially for those who have participated in intramurals in the past.</p>
